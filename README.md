## Why This List Matters
The manufacturing sector, especially in regions like Windsor-Detroit (the "Automotive Capital of Canada"), is ripe for innovation. Small and medium factories need affordable, accessible tools to automate assembly lines, monitor equipment, and optimize production. This list aims to empower developers to build solutions that help these factories compete with larger players, addressing challenges like those highlighted in recent discussions on X (e.g., the need for Windsor SMEs to innovate independently of large automakers).

## How to Use This List
- **Developers**: Use these APIs to build apps for factory automation, robotic control, quality inspection, and more. Many APIs offer free tiers or trials, making them accessible for prototyping.
- **SMEs**: Explore these tools to modernize your factory floor without breaking the bank. From robotic arms to predictive maintenance, there's something for every manufacturing need.
- **Students & Hobbyists**: Experiment with these APIs to learn about smart manufacturing and industrial automation. Many are open-source or have free simulators (e.g., URSim, Gazebo).
